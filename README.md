# ChessEngine

This is an Open Source project for building a unique chess engine.

I want to implement my learnings of the game and also improve coding skills. The idea is to use my intuition to create a unique engine.

Currently working on the frontend & populating the chessboard.

Any collaborations are welcomed.
